  <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 153);">Everybody try to solve this global problem. Lately, many scientist hasve their own way to make a problem solver. So, the most effective solution is from natural things such as bamboo, algae, kangaroo's waste, etc. In Indonesia itself have used paper from <em>Aloe vera</em> which discovered by chemical student on Jogyakarta's collage. Believe,we can solve this together. Remember, we who started this, we also have to end this.<br/>

<h2 style="color:">Alternative Materials Processing Paper</h2>


<div class="clear" style="height:4px;"></div>
<div class="rich_description" style="margin: 8px;"><p>Finally there is an alternative raw material for paper that is of the Red Algae (Gelidium amansii). In the process was almost no contact with chemicals, only takes a neutral chemicals such as chlorine and bleaching processes using chlorine.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>Availability of raw materials (Red Algae) are also relatively safe. Annual required even tens of years to grow trees, while the Red Algae only need time in months. And that can be cultivated easily in a calm sea waters. Indonesia has a lot of this region.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>If you have found the existence of alternative materials are more environmentally friendly then the next step is to make it happen. That the paper industry must switch from wood to red algae as the raw material. And towards this necessary concrete measures and concerns of various parties.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>The role of parties would be important, at least in my observation, the parties have a serious role, among others: First, clear the Government. As policy makers, the government must dare to take the attitude that the production of paper have to switch from wood to red algae. And take steps to support the production and development of the Red Alga this research. Second, the paper manufacturers have knowingly and willing to move using the red algae as the feedstock. Third, coastal community (fishermen) to develop this Red Algae cultivation, because it obviously would make economic improvement. Fourth, universities can take a role in the development of more in-depth research.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>And fifth, the MUI (Indonesian Ulama Council), as the institution which issued a &quot;rubber stamp&quot; lawful for a product then the MUI must dare to issue a &quot;rubber stamp&quot; unlawful for paper production from wood raw material causes environmental damage. Even if you need any product in the process that can destroy the environment, oppressing the workers are not given the halal label. Approximately how if so?</p>
