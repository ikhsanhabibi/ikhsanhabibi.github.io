But, do you realize that is so dangerous to our life? In Indonesia, thereis a proverb that say &quot;Senjata Makan Tuan.&quot; That means a gun which supposed to protect his master, instead make his master in danger. Have you ever think when you use paper it same that you will decreasing tree population? Wake up buddy, you do not want to be an enemy of the earth?<br/>

Plastic is versatile, lightweight, flexible, moisture resistant, durable, strong and relatively inexpensive. Lately, the used of plastic is very increasing. Plastic is consist of many chemical element that is so dangerous for human health, especialy for children. Phthalates is the most conceived element in plastic. In the fact, Phthalates known to disrupt the endocrine system, have been linked to numerous health conditions including cancers. Because of that, we realize how much it will destroy our environment and our future. In this project we will give a solution, recommendation, and to awake how hazardous this problem if the people of the earth still do not care about their universe and their own earth.

<div class="clear" style="height:4px;"></div>
<div class="rich_description" style="margin: 8px;"><p style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="color: rgb(128, 128, 0);">
    <strong>
      <span style="font-size: small;">
        <span lang="en" id="result_box">
          <span title="">Humans are the components of the ecosystem that can be potentially as a savior and destroyer of ecosystems. </span>
          <span title="">Examples  of human activities that damage the ecosystem is deforestation and the  construction of settlements without regard to environmental aspects.<br/>
            <br/>
          </span>
          <span title="">Sometimes people create an ecosystem that had good aims. </span>
          <span title="">But over time, it even can be turned around because of his own human ego. </span>
          <span title="">For  example, the wetland ecosystems contained locusts, farmers will  eradicate the pests which indirectly destroy the locust predators. </span>
          <span title="">This is tantamount disrupt the food chain.<br/>
            <br/>
          </span>
          <span title="">Basically, the ecosystem still can repair itself (self purification) to achieve balance again within a certain timeframe. </span>
          <span title="">A minute or longer, depending on the level of damage. </span>
          <span title="">Unfortunately, humans often have even more damaging ecosystems that are trying to improve himself. </span>
          <span title="">So, one might say that the components of the most potent destroyer of ecosystems are human.<br/>
            <br/>
          </span>
          <span title="">Why humans? </span>
          <span title="">Are not many natural disasters which are very damaging to the ecosystem? </span>
          <span title="">The answer is easy, 'Because most of the disaster was man himself who created'.<br/>
            <br/>
          </span>
          <span title="">Global Warming or Global Warming, the hot topics discussed was also one of the result of human activities. </span>
          <span title="">&quot;Most  of the increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th  century most likely caused by increased concentrations of greenhouse  gases caused by human activities through the greenhouse effect,&quot; as the  conclusion of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).<br/>
            <br/>
          </span>
          <span title="">The occurrence of Global Warming can also destroy the ecosystem. </span>
          <span title="">Just  imagine if the earth's temperature has increased so that the animals  tend to migrate toward the poles or up mountains, plants will change the  direction of its growth, finding new areas because of the length of  habitat becomes too warm. </span>
          <span title="">However, due to human development prevents this displacement, the species that migrate unobstructed. </span>
          <span title="">Some types of species that are not able to quickly move may be destroyed. </span>
          <span title="">For  humans, animal migration can be a big problem with the spread of  various diseases and the spread of viruses that carried the animal. </span>
          <span title="">For example, increasing the occurrence of dengue fever because mosquitoes have to breed a new ecosystem.<br/>
            <br/>
          </span>
          <span title="">Of course we do not want the earth destroyed ecosystems. </span>
          <span title="">As inhabitants of the earth the most perfect human being should be able to come take care of this earth. </span>
          <span title="">Things to do is to anticipate our daily activities. </span>
          <span title="">Activities that if damage to the environment should be reduced and eliminated. </span>
          <span title="">While the tradition of preserving the environment should digencarkan. </span>
          <span title="">Start from small things like planting trees to other activities. </span>
          <span title="">Although simple, at least we took part in the effort to 'cure' ecosystem. </span>
          <span title="">Not just for the sake of the ecosystem and the physical universe, but also for life in the future.</span>
